    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p>Weather in the Grand Canyon is at its best between April and June, when rainfall averages are low and temperatures have not yet reached their scorching summer highs. Temperatures can drop below freezing as early as September, so wear layers if you're planning to visit in the late summer or early fall.
